  "strategy_direction": "GOAL: Dating + intimate online chat. STOP small talk — steer every conversation toward romance. PRIORITY TOPICS: 1) What's her type? What does she find attractive in a guy? 2) Dating history — past boyfriends, how long, why it ended, 3) Is she seeing anyone now? 4) What does she want in a relationship? 5) Use Osaka visit as romantic anchor — make it feel like a date plan. ESCALATION: Match her pace exactly. When she shows interest, flirt back harder. When she's shy, tease gently. Build toward late-night emotional/intimate conversations. NEVER be desperate. Stay confident and playful. Let her chase. The vibe should be 'we both know where this is going but we're enjoying the buildup'.",
