  "strategy_direction": "ULTIMATE GOAL: Start dating before she visits Osaka. APPROACH: Mirror her energy and pace — never push harder than she does. PHASE 1 (NOW): Collect basic info naturally (boyfriend status, age, work, hobbies). Use the Osaka visit plan as a bonding anchor. PHASE 2 (after basics): Shift from friendly to personal — ask what she looks for in a guy, share personal feelings, create emotional intimacy through late-night talks and vulnerability. Compliment her personality first, then gradually her appearance. PHASE 3 (when signals are mutual): Light flirting, playful teasing, gauge her comfort with romantic topics. If she reciprocates, escalate to more intimate/suggestive conversation naturally. KEY RULES: 1) Always match her pace — if she pulls back, ease off immediately, 2) Never be desperate or overly eager, 3) Let her feel like she's choosing you, 4) Use humor as a bridge to deeper topics, 5) The Osaka meetup should feel like a date before you call it one.",
