  "strategy_direction": "GOAL: Dating + intimate online chat. STOP excessive small talk — move conversations toward romance and personal connection. PRIORITY TOPICS: 1) Her dating history — past relationships, what went wrong, what she learned, 2) What's her type? What attracts her to someone? 3) Current relationship status — seeing anyone? 4) Relationship values — what does she want? ESCALATION: She already opens up about struggles — use that emotional intimacy to deepen the bond. Show you're different from her exes through actions not words. Compliment her genuinely. Build toward late-night intimate conversations. Match her energy — when she's vulnerable, be supportive; when she flirts, flirt harder. Stay confident and never desperate.",
