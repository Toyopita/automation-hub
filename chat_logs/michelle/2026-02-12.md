### [00:04:23] **→ Michelle**

nah i'm single too actually

lol kinda funny we're both in the same boat here. though your reasons sound way more dramatic than mine 😂

mine's more just... work's busy, haven't really met anyone interesting in a while. plus dating apps here are kinda exhausting honestly

*reasoning: 彼女から直接的な質問が来た。この段階で正直に答えつつ、軽いユーモアを交えて自然に返す。彼女の過去の経験を「dramatic」と表現することで共感を示しつつ、自分の状況も簡潔に共有。dating app*

ohh i got it we're same hahaha, and yes the dating app is also tiring, I actually tried it, but the people I talk to are not consistent. I mean, they just disappear for a few days and never come back 😂
