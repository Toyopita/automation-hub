nah i'm single too actually

lol kinda funny we're both in the same boat here. though your reasons sound way more dramatic than mine 😂

mine's more just... work's busy, haven't really met anyone interesting in a while. plus dating apps here are kinda exhausting honestly

*reasoning: 彼女から直接的な質問が来た。この段階で正直に答えつつ、軽いユーモアを交えて自然に返す。彼女の過去の経験を「dramatic」と表現することで共感を示しつつ、自分の状況も簡潔に共有。dating app*

ohh i got it we're same hahaha, and yes the dating app is also tiring, I actually tried it, but the people I talk to are not consistent. I mean, they just disappear for a few days and never come back 😂

yeah ghosting is so annoying honestly. like why match with someone if you're not even gonna talk haha

guess it's the same everywhere, people just get bored or find someone else and don't bother saying anything

*reasoning: 彼女は dating app での経験を共有している。共感しつつ、短く自然に返す。質問は控えめにしてpull気味に。2文で十分*
