oh the translation thing? basically i just have it running in the background on my phone. when i get a message in english it shows me a quick japanese translation, and when i type in japanese it translates to english before sending. pretty seamless honestly

makes convos way easier lol. otherwise id be stuck with my broken english

oh nice! restaurant work must keep you busy haha. i do office work mostly, sometimes engineering stuff too. pretty standard desk job but i like it, feels meaningful you know? 

what kind of restaurant? like what type of food?

You must be very busy, with work that is very mentally draining. Indonesian specialty restaurant

### [20:53:48] **→ Vita**

ooh indonesian food! that sounds really good actually. do you cook or more like serving/managing side?

and yeah of course, ask away!
