Gradually deepen the connection by: 1) Naturally asking about her love life (boyfriend, relationship status), 2) Showing genuine interest in her feelings and daily life, 3) Personality-based compliments ('you're easy to talk to', 'you're really thoughtful'), 4) Gently building romantic undertones once the door opens, 5) Do NOT rush - stay warm and genuine, let her lead the pace",
