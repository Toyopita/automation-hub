  "strategy_direction": "GOAL: Dating + intimate online chat. She already said she has no boyfriend and is waiting for the right person — this is a green light. STOP small talk — steer toward romance. PRIORITY TOPICS: 1) What's her ideal type? What does she find attractive? 2) Past dating experience — has she been in love before? 3) What does she want in a relationship? 4) Build on her emotional availability — she offered to be a listener, now YOU be vulnerable too. ESCALATION: She's open and warm. Push toward personal/romantic topics. Compliment her — she's caring, thoughtful. Make her feel special. Build toward late-night conversations with emotional and then physical intimacy topics. Stay confident and playful, never needy.",
