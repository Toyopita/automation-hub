Relationship status, 2) What's her type? What attracts her? 3) Dating history — past relationships, experiences, 4) What does she want in a partner? ESCALATION: Match her pace. When she shows warmth, escalate. Ask personal questions naturally. Build emotional intimacy first, then romantic tension. Compliment her genuinely. Aim for late-night intimate conversations. Stay confident, playful, never desperate.",
